Here is a centralized source of documentation for processes, automations, and quirks on Buildertrend's Tableau Server. This knowledge base is maintained by Abby Schneider.

# Our Environments
The primary divisions on our server are between our "sites". Really, they're subdivisions of the main site, tableau.buildertrend.com. 

### [[The Development Site]]
This is located at `https://tableau.buildertrend.net/#/site/development/home`. 
The main purpose of this site is for content authors to have a designated safe zone where content can be published without any restrictions. Scratch work, scrappy analyses, and WIP reports belong here.
### [[The Main Site]] 
This is for production-ready content. I will populate this with more content as time goes on.
